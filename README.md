# Data Science Bootcamp

## Overview

The purpose of this data science bootcamp is to give people with an analytics & cloud computing background an introduction to Python-based data science with a focus on Microsoft technologies and particularly the Microsoft Azure cloud.

The following content will be covered in this bootcamp:
1. Bootcamp Introduction & Tools Setup
2. Data Visualization with Python
3. Statistics & Machine Learning Fundamentals
4. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
5. Supervised Machine Learning
6. Unsupervised Machine Learning
7. Deep Learning
8. Applied Data Science with Azure
9. Distributed Computing & Spark with Azure Databricks
10. MLOps in Azure
11. Industry Use Cases & Project Lifecycle
12. Advanced Topics Overview

All of this content builds on each other but is also designed to be self-sustained so that the selectively interested reader can dive directly into specific topics.
